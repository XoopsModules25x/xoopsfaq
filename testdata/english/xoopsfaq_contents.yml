    contents_title: 'Which databases are supported by xoops?'
    contents_contents: 'At the time of writing, XOOPS only supports a MySQL database. Support for other databases is in the planning phase, but so far the need for this functionality has been limited and the XOOPS team believes that it is better to support one database 100% than supporting many more databases 70%.'

    contents_title: 'How do I connect to a database?'
    contents_contents: "The most common database used with a XOOPS installation is [b]MySQL[/b], an excellent open source database.\r\n\r\nTo connect you Xoops installation to a database you need three items:\r\n\r\n1. A database name.\r\n\r\n2. A database username\r\n\r\n3. A database password.\r\n\r\nAll of this information is stored in [b]secure.php[/b] config file, so XOOPS can automatically connect to the database as needed."

    contents_title: 'What is PHP?'
    contents_contents: "PHP (recursive acronym for [b]PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor[/b]) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.\r\n\r\nNice, but what does that mean? An example:\r\n\r\nExample #1 An introductory example\r\n\r\n[code]<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html>\r\n    <head>\r\n        <title>Example</title>\r\n    </head>\r\n    <body>\r\n\r\n        <?php\r\n            echo \"Hi, I'm a PHP script!\";\r\n        ?>\r\n\r\n    </body>\r\n</html>[/code]\r\n\r\nInstead of lots of commands to output HTML (as seen in C or Perl), PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code that does \"something\" (in this case, output \"Hi, I'm a PHP script!\"). The PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions <?php and ?> that allow you to jump into and out of \"PHP mode.\""
